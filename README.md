# Keras-Basics
Objective:
To classify bank notes were forgeries or legitimate using Keras.

Reference:https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning

Data:
Researchers created dataset from bank notes by taking images of bank notes and then extracting numerical features based off the wavelet of the images.
# Keras-CNN with MNIST
Objective:
To Classify Handwritten single Digit from 0 to 9.

More about MNIST Data http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Dataset has 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images with 28 X 28 pixels.The value of 0 represents white and 1 represents black.So the image is a grayscale.

Keras with CNN python noebook help to walkthrogh steps to implement CNN using Keras.
